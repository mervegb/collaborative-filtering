# Collaborative Filtering
This project implements a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system using techniques like Matrix Factorization (SVD) and cosine similarity. The system reduces the dimensionality of a user-item matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), calculates item similarities, and recommends movies based on their similarity to a given movie.

Collaborative Filtering works by analying user interactions with items (such as ratings)
- User-Based Filtering: finds users who are similar to the target user and recommends items based on their preferences
- Item-Based Filtering: finds items similar to ones a user has interacted with and recommends those items


  In this project, focus is on item-based filtering, recommending movies that are similar to a movie that the user has already watched.
